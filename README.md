# Creating 3D Landscapes with OpenTopography and Rayshader

This is an R Markdown Notebook created by OpenTopography profiling the [RayShader](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rayshader/rayshader.pdf) package. This package utilizes a combination of raytracing and multiple hill shading methods to produce 2D and 3D data visualizations and maps.
